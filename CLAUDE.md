- This is the source of the R-ArcGIS Bridge package {clacite} which provides bindings to Esri Calcite Design System components.
- The components were originally automatically generated by data-raw/generate-component-new.R
- The auto-generated shiny bindings are created via inst/www/calcite-bindings.js
- We are in the process of re-writing them manually.

## Creating new components

When creating a new component:

- remind me to remove the component from R/components-generated.R
- remind me to remove the binding from inst/www/calcite-bindings.js
- create a new binding inst/www/calcite-{component}.js
- add the binding using `htmltools::htmlDependency()` 


R/action.R example: 
```
  action_binding <- htmltools::htmlDependency(
    name = "calcite-action-binding",
    version = calcite_version(),
    src = c(file = system.file("www", package = "calcite")),
    script = "calcite-action.js"
  )
```

- Component properties (except read-only) must be arguments
- Component slots must be arguments
- Ignore all deprecated properties and slots
- Bindings must register each event

- New components must have a `inst/examples/calcite-{component}.R` file based on calcite JS examples
  - The example should always use `verbatimTextOutput()` to show how components change


## Etiquette

- Never run R code, ask me to.
- Use `compact()` to remove NULL elements from a list
- Use `rlang::arg_match()` to validate input string values
