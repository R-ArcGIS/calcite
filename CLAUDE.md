- This is the source of the R-ArcGIS Bridge package {clacite} which provides bindings to Esri Calcite Design System components.
- The components were originally automatically generated by data-raw/generate-component-new.R
- The auto-generated shiny bindings are created via inst/www/calcite-bindings.js
- We are in the process of re-writing them manually.

## Banned actions

You are banned from performing the below actions. 

- Running any shell commands without permission
- Calling R in any way shape or form
- Using Git for committing, pushing, or merging


## Creating new components

When creating a new component:

- remind me to remove the component from R/components-generated.R
- remind me to remove the binding from inst/www/calcite-bindings.js
- create a new binding inst/www/calcite-{component}.js
- add the binding using `htmltools::htmlDependency()` 


R/action.R example: 
```
  action_binding <- htmltools::htmlDependency(
    name = "calcite-action-binding",
    version = calcite_version(),
    src = c(file = system.file("www", package = "calcite")),
    script = "calcite-action.js"
  )
```

- Component properties (except read-only) must be arguments
- Component slots must be arguments and MUST use `add_slot()` helper - see R/panel.R for reference
- Ignore all deprecated properties and slots
- Bindings must register each event

- New components must have a `inst/examples/calcite-{component}.R` file based on calcite JS examples
  - **Always include `devtools::load_all()` at the top of each example**
  - **Only create `verbatimTextOutput()` for components that have reactive state or emit events**
  - Create separate `verbatimTextOutput()` for each component with reactive state
  - In `renderPrint()`, display the raw reactive value directly: `input$component_id`
  - **NEVER construct custom lists or extract specific properties** - show the full reactive object as-is
  - Reference inst/examples/calcite-block.R as the pattern to follow


## Etiquette

- Never run R code, ask me to.
- Use `compact()` to remove NULL elements from a list
- Use `rlang::arg_match()` to validate input string values
